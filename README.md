**What?**

This is a pseudo-calender planner for a typical 9 to 5 workday. Users can add their plans into their desired time (9 am to 5 pm) in the textbox next to it, and save it. Their work will not disappear as the save function saves their inputted text into the pc's localstorage in which in will be automatically show upon reopening the webpage. 
However, if the user wishes to erase their saved inputted text, a "clear" button has been added. This "clear" button erases their localstorage data and refreshs the page, resulting in a clean slate. 


**Acquired Knowledge**

Throughout this assignment I have gotten a better understanding of 3rd-party libraries (eg. Bootstrap and JQuery). While I am far from being comfortable with these libraries as shown with my use of vanilla Javascript and having the trouble of making it mobile responsive; they have provided useful and time-saving ways of implementing the desired code. This has made the progress of building this website less cumbersome and more efficient.

Here are some of the functions I learnt:
1. "$(this).parent/siblings()" //Targets the parent or sibling(s) of the targeted element/variable with the "this" element.
2.  "`${i}`" using the `` operator along with ${variable} to add a variable within a string.  
3. Adding fonts/symbols with Google Fonts
4. In Bootstrap, the use of adding classes to implement pre-built css such as row or col for a nice and simple layout. Along with adding display(flex), justify-content, etc.

In addition to these links, I would like to acknowledge and credit the help I had from a tutor in a one-on-one session. They have helped me in introducing the "`${i}`" function, which results in less overall code, and as well as the "classList.add" function.
